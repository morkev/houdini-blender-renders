# Houdini-Blender-Renders
This a just a little repository where I share some of my 3D rendering projects. Please, feel free to play with caustics, change the parameters in the python scripts, add nodes and other stuff. Ruin the project and go back (we, unlike others, have the ability to create back-ups and travel in time).
