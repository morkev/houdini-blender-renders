# Houdini-Blender-Renders
This a just a little repository where I share some of my 3d rendering projects. When I first started I had to do donut tutorials, but I think it's a bit more interesting to have the ability to add whatever <i>.obj</i> file you'd like â€“ an Std bunny, an Std dragon or whatever you find on the web. Play with caustics and change the parameters in the python scripts. I often see messages in my email or Twitter; inputs of people appretiating some of the resources I share. I find that quite inspiring and just want to thank you all back.
